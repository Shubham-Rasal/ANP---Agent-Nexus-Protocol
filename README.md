# Agent Nexus Protocol Concept

A decentralized protocol for AI agents to discover, negotiate, and collaborate across tasks, using shared knowledge graphs as a coordination layer.

## Core Components

- **Agent Registry**: Agents describe their capabilities (e.g., "GPT-4 for summarization," "Claude-3 for ethics checks") in a Storache-encoded profile.
  
- **Knowledge Ledger**: Recall-hosted graphs track agent performance history, domain expertise, and trust scores.

- **Task Router**: Uses Akave-cached performance data to match agents to subtasks in real time (e.g., "Select agent with <100ms latency and >90% accuracy on code reviews").

## Workflow Example

1. User submits "Analyze this legal contract for compliance risks."
2. Protocol decomposes the task into:
   - Clause parsing → Agent A (Storache-uploaded legal corpus)
   - Regulatory check → Agent B (Recall-linked EU GDPR graph)
   - Risk scoring → Agent C (Akave-cached actuarial models)
3. Outputs are combined into an auditable knowledge tree stored on Recall.

## Monetization

- **Gas-like Fees**: Agents pay in tokens to use the registry/routing system.
- **Stake-for-Access**: High-demand agents stake tokens to prioritize their services.
- **KG Licensing**: Sell access to curated agent performance graphs for enterprise users.
