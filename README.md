# Agent Nexus Protocol (ANP)

## 🌟 Overview

Agent Nexus Protocol (ANP) is an innovative framework designed to enable seamless communication and collaboration between AI agents. Built as a hackathon project, ANP provides a standardized protocol for agent-to-agent interactions, allowing different AI systems to work together efficiently and effectively.

## 🚀 Features

- **Standardized Communication Protocol**: Define and implement a common language for AI agents to communicate
- **Agent Discovery**: Dynamic discovery and registration of available agents in the network
- **Message Routing**: Intelligent routing of messages between agents based on capabilities and requirements
- **State Management**: Robust handling of agent states and conversation contexts
- **Security**: Built-in security measures for safe agent interactions
- **Extensibility**: Easy-to-extend architecture for adding new agent types and capabilities

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- Redis for state management
- Protocol Buffers for message serialization
- WebSocket support for real-time communication

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Redis server
- Protocol Buffers compiler
- pip (Python package manager)

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agent-nexus-protocol.git
cd agent-nexus-protocol
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. Start the Redis server:
```bash
redis-server
```

2. Run the ANP server:
```bash
python -m anp.server
```

3. Register your first agent:
```bash
python -m anp.tools.register_agent --name "my-agent" --capabilities "text,image"
```

### Quick Example

```python
from anp.client import ANPClient

# Initialize client
client = ANPClient()

# Register an agent
agent = client.register_agent(
    name="assistant",
    capabilities=["text-processing", "task-planning"]
)

# Send a message to another agent
response = agent.send_message(
    target_agent="executor",
    content="Please analyze this text",
    metadata={"priority": "high"}
)
```
