## 🚀 Features

- **Standardized Communication Protocol**: Define and implement a common interface for AI agents to communicate
- **Intelligent Routing**: Directs queries to the most capable agent based on expertise and context.
- **Chain of Thought Sharing**: Agents can share their reasoning process, enabling transparent collaboration.
- **Decentralized Knowledge**: A distributed system where each agent maintains specialized knowledge while contributing to a collective intelligence.

##  Lilypad

We integrated Lilypad's powerful APIs to implement a major componant - Task Router

- Built a **task router** that analyzes what users are asking for and sends them to the right specialized agent
- Added **web search capabilities** so our agents can find up-to-date information when answering questions
- Created a system where different models work together on complex tasks, with each handling what they're best at

Check out our implementation in [task-router/route.ts](https://github.com/Shubham-Rasal/ANP---Agent-Nexus-Protocol/blob/master/frontend/src/app/api/task-router/route.ts)!

## Akave

Akave's decentralized storage powers our secure agent marketplace:

- Implemented a **storage tool** that lets agents securely store and retrieve data
- Built an **agent marketplace** where users can browse, select, and "stake" on different specialized agents

See how we did it in [akave-storage.ts](https://github.com/Shubham-Rasal/ANP---Agent-Nexus-Protocol/blob/master/frontend/src/features/agents/leadgen/akave-storage.ts)!

## Storacha

We used Storacha to enable true agent collaboration:

- Built a system where agents can **store their thinking process** and share it with other agents
- Created tools for agents to **learn from each other's work** and build on previous insights
- Implemented **transparent tracking** of all knowledge-sharing operations

Check out our collaboration system in [storacha-tool.ts](https://github.com/Shubham-Rasal/ANP---Agent-Nexus-Protocol/blob/master/frontend/src/features/agents/leadgen/storacha-tool.ts)!
