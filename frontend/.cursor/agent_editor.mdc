To make our system really useful, I am thinking of  solving the following problem

Task 

automated lead management

what agents are needed?

email finder - to finder the email of people asked for. This agent will receive a link to profile or x.com link

sheets agent - adds leads to a sheet

gmail agent - drafts a mail with the context received from the previous steps

calender assistant  - schedules appointments on my calender

briefer agent

AI agent that texts me a meeting briefing 30 minutes before each meeting.
It reviews their LinkedIn for a bio + our recent emails for context. Incredible.

I need to build an extensible way to implement an automated lead management agents. I don't want to hardcode the agent workflow. This is just an example. I need to build infrastructure to build similar agents and workflows.

Creating agents is customisable. each agent will have following parameters - prompt, model (llm), skills. Skills can be anything like sending a mail, drafting a message, browsing the web, setting up calender. 

I need to be able to create the following 

- self contained tools that can be used assigned to any agent during agent creation process
- a flow based workflow editor to implement my workflow

For the flow based editor, we will use reactflow
