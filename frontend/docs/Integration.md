Creating an Extensible Chat-Workflow Integration Framework
You're looking for a more flexible system where workflows aren't hardcoded for lead generation but can be selected and applied to any domain. Here's a more extensible approach:
Extensible Architecture Plan
1. Workflow Selection & Chat Initialization
Allow users to select from a library of workflow templates when creating a new chat
Store workflow metadata with the chat session
Enable custom workflow creation through the workflow editor
Support saving and sharing workflows between users
2. Universal Query Router
Create a domain-agnostic task router that can work with any workflow type
Design the router to analyze queries based on the active workflow's context
Support dynamic task decomposition based on workflow capabilities
Allow workflows to register their own intent patterns and triggers
3. Workflow Registry System
Implement a central registry for all available workflows
Include metadata like workflow purpose, capabilities, and required tools
Tag workflows with domains (lead gen, customer support, research, etc.)
Support versioning of workflows
4. Contextual Execution Engine
Build a workflow execution engine that maintains context between chat interactions
Allow workflows to access chat history for better context awareness
Support long-running workflows that span multiple chat interactions
Enable workflows to request additional information from users when needed
5. Extensible Tool Integration
Leverage your existing tool system to allow workflows to use any registered tool
Support dynamic tool discovery and registration
Allow workflows to specify required tool capabilities
Handle authentication and permissions for tools at the workflow level
Implementation Strategy
Step 1: Workflow Selection Interface
Create a workflow browser component for the chat creation flow
Show available workflows with descriptions, tags, and capabilities
Allow filtering and searching of workflows
Support "blank chat" option for non-workflow interactions
Step 2: Chat-Workflow Context Management
Enhance the chat state to include the active workflow and its state
Maintain workflow variables and context between messages
Create a bidirectional communication channel between chat and workflow
Step 3: Universal Task Router Enhancement
Modify the task router to be workflow-aware
2. Allow workflows to register custom decomposition rules
Support dynamic agent selection based on workflow requirements
Create a plugin system for specialized task analysis
Step 4: Workflow Execution Visualization
Enhance the workflow panel to show real-time execution for any workflow type
Create a standardized progress reporting interface
Support interactive workflow steps that can request user input
Show workflow history and allow reviewing previous executions
Step 5: Workflow Creation and Management
Extend the workflow editor to support saving workflows as templates
Add workflow testing capabilities
Create a workflow marketplace concept for sharing
Support workflow import/export
Example User Flow
User clicks "New Chat" and sees workflow selection screen
User browses categories: "Lead Generation," "Research," "Content Creation," etc.
User selects "Lead Prospecting Workflow" and starts a new chat
Chat interface shows the active workflow name and a brief description
User types: "Find information about Acme Corp and their CTO"
System routes this query through the workflow's registered handlers
Workflow decomposes the task into:
Company research (Acme Corp)
Executive identification (find CTO)
Contact information gathering
Each step executes with appropriate agents and tools
Results flow back into the chat as structured messages
Workflow state is preserved for follow-up queries
